## About oil.js

The OIL project aims for a stable cross-company solution for the challenges the GDPR and new EU ePrivacy Regulation will pose to our business.

* Data privacy opt-in overlay for all users of services offered by various Axel Springer brands and/or units
* Supports the [IAB specification](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework) explains how a vendor should communicate with a CMP to gather consent information before running any data processing. That API is a set of JavaScript functions. You can find more at the official website http://advertisingconsent.eu/

* Local opt-in (called "Site Opt-In", SOI) as well as group-based cross-company opt-in (called "Power Opt-In", POI)
* Advanced Settings with Cookie Preference Center (CPC)

The Opt-In Layer (OIL) is an offical link:http://advertisingconsent.eu/iab-europe-transparency-consent-framework-list-of-registered-cmps/[Consent Management Provider (CMP)] after the IAB Europe "Transparency & Consent Framework".

## Development
### Installation / Build

After 'install' there is a post install step which automatically runs build.

```
npm install
```

### Basic Usage

* Start App locally: `npm start`
* Creating Docs: `npm run build:docs`

### Testing 
#### Unit tests

* Running unit-tests: `npm run test`

There are two kinds of unit tests: For the oil.js itself (``npm run test:unit``) and for the node server delivering all files (``npm run test:node``)

#### E2E tests (Selenium)

* Before testing locally add the following dns entries into your /etc/hosts
```
127.0.0.1	oilsite1
127.0.0.1	oilsite2
127.0.0.1	oilcdn
```

* Running end2end-tests locally: Start app in one terminal `npm start` and then in the next terminal `npm run e2e`

#### Advanced Usage

npm run build:release creates an app version that loads its parts
from oil.axelspringer.com/release/*.min.js

This should be used in production.

#### debug logging

NODE_DEBUG=oil-debug npm run ...
